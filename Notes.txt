Problem in smtp For sending email through django settings -
Hey guys, just found what’s going on with those errors.

The problem is that when you have activated the Google Authenticator Verification you also need to set up the 2-Step-Authentication in your gmail account.

Therefore visit https://www.google.com/settings/security - when you have done so, just go back to this page and click the “App Password” - Settings.

Select “Other (custom name)” and enter any name you like. Go ahead and copy the code and paste it to your projects settings.
